# Cleave_angle_analysis
This code will measure all the cleave angles of each fiber 

The code will read the .mat surface files from the EQuIP bucket drive. For each file it will measure the angle for mutliple cross sections to determine the steepest angle and hence the actual fibre face angle.

The code repeats for every surface saved in the file and presents the distribution of angles for a particular cleave tension.
